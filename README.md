# MNIST Classifiers

This repository includes two classifiers for the MNIST dataset: a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), implemented with TensorFlow/Keras.

## Features

- **MLP Classifier**: Simple fully connected neural network for digit classification.
- **CNN Classifier**: Convolutional network that captures spatial features in images.
